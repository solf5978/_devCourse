In this challenge, you are going to create a mad lib generator! You should 
start by printing a welcome message to the console. Then, get user input for a 
noun, verb, adjective, and adverb and store the values in variables. After 
that, format a string to tell a short story using the user's inputs and store 
it in a variable. Finally, output the story to the console.
