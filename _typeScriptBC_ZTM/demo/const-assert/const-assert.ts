// `as const` allows you to create readonly values in your code. When you use
// `as const` on an object, array or tuple, TypeScript infers that the values
// are constant and cannot be modified later. This can help prevent unexpected
// bugs in your code and make it easier to reason about. It's particularly
// useful when working with APIs or configurations where values should not be
// changed during runtime.
