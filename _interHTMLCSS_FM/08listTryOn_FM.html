    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 quart of cream</li>
      <li>1 wineglassful of curaçao</li>
      <li>1/2 pound of sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoonfuls of orange blossoms water</li>
      <li>Juice of two oranges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Put the sugar and half the cream over the fire in a double boiler.</li>
  
      <li>When the sugar is dissolved, take it from the fire, and let it cool.</li>
  
      <li> When cold, add the curaçao, orange juice and orange blossoms water, and the remaining cream.</li>
  
      <li>Freeze.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h3>Instructions for freezing</h3>
  
    <dl class="freezing">
      <dt>Needed equipment:</dt>
      <dd>4-quart freezer</dd>
      <dd>10 lb. ice</dd>
      <dd>3 pints coarse rock salt</dd>
    </dl>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Before beginning to pack the freezer, turn the crank to see that all the machinery is in working order.</li>
  
      <li>Pound the ice in a large bag with a mallet, or use an ordinary ice shaver. The finer the ice, the less time it takes to freeze the cream.</li>
  
      <li>You may pack the freezer with a layer of ice three inches thick, then a layer of salt one inch thick, or mix the ice and salt in the tub and shovel it around the freezer.</li>
  
      <li>Open the can and turn in the mixture that is to be frozen.</li>
  
      <li>Turn the crank slowly and steadily until the mixture begins to freeze, then more rapidly until it is completely frozen.</li>
    </ol>
