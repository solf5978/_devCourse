    <p>Ah, coffee. Whether you adore a whipped-topped Starbucks, a hot local cup of joe, or a cold brew as black as oil, or if you have children, like I do, you're probably addicted. I even own one of those mugs with the chemical formula for caffeine C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emblazoned on the side.</p>
  
    <p>You see, I was under the impression that I drank a lot of coffee, so I was surprised to read that, according to the International Coffee Organization<sup>[1]</sup>, even Canada, in 10<sup>th</sup> place, is close to triple the coffee consumption of the average American. </p>
  
    <p>The top spot for coffee consumption goes to Finland, followed closely by the heavily-caffinated Nordic countries of Norway, Iceland and Denmark.<sup>[2]</sup> Believe it or not, the average adult Finn drinks 27.5 pounds of coffee each year!</p>
